# Quantile extraction from compound distributions

The program can be used to compute any quantiles from a compound distribution where there is no closed form formula.

Fourier transform is a better alternative to the simulation approach in terms of computation time. It is also a good alternative to Panjer recursion. 

The method is applicable to property and casualty insurance, pyschology studies, and operational risk management where aggregate/compound distributions are used. 

In these areas, researchers are interested in either Randomly Stopped Sums mixed effect regressions or distributions without covariates.
