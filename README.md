# Quantile extraction from compound distributions

The program can be used to compute any quantiles from a compound distribution where there is no closed form formula.
The same calculation can be done simulation, but simulation usually take much longer computation time. 
The method is applicable to property and casualty insurance, pyschology studies, and operational risk.
